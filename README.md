# **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention**

- **This project is in a beta phase** due to limited testing at this time.. Although primarily developed for learning purposes, it effectively addresses my specific needs.
- **Important:** Follow the instructions in the **Releases section** when updating the script. Updates may include new features or changes that could require different steps. I‚Äôll strive to keep the instructions as simple as possible.
- **Currently supported:** Linux only. While it might work on macOS, it has not been tested yet.

## **About AutoTarCompress**

- The script compresses specific directories into tar files (e.g., 01-01-2025.tar.xz) and is able to encrypt them using the OpenSSL Python library.
- It also allows for decryption and extraction of the created files.

## **üí° How to Use**

1. Open a terminal and clone this repo (make sure you have git installed):

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads &
   git clone https://github.com/Cyber-Syntax/AutoTarCompress.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/Cyber-Syntax/AutoTarCompress
   ```

3. **Optional: Create a virtual environment (Recommended)**

   - Create a virtual environment:
     - `python3 -m venv .venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - Install dependencies using `pip`:
     - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - If this doesn't work, install manually (some of them may already be installed; exclude those if you encounter an error again).
     - `pip3 install tqdm`

4. Activate the virtual environment (if applicable):

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Config File Handling:

   - To customize your backup settings, you need to use a `config.json` file. This file allows you to specify:
     - Backup folder location, Directories to back up, Directories to ignore, Number of tar.xz and tar.xz.enc files to keep
   - **Creating a Config File:**
     - You have two options:
       1. **Use an example config file (Recommended)**:
          - Copy the example configuration from `config_files_example/config.json`
          - Paste it into your `backup_folder/config_files/config.json` location (e.g `~/Documents/backup-for-cloud/config_files/config.json`)
          - Modify it as needed
       2. **Run the script and follow the on-screen instructions**.
          - This will guide you through creating a `config.json` file.

6. Start the script:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

7. Follow the on-screen instructions.
