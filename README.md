# **‚ö†Ô∏è Attention**

- **This project is in a beta phase** due to limited testing at this time.. Although primarily developed for learning purposes, it effectively addresses my specific needs.
- **Important:** Follow the instructions in the **Releases section** when updating the script. Updates may include new features or changes that could require different steps. I‚Äôll strive to keep the instructions as simple as possible.
- **Currently supported:** Linux only. While it might work on macOS, it has not been tested yet.

## **About AutoTarCompress**

- The script compresses specific directories into tar files (e.g., 01-01-2025.tar.xz) and is able to encrypt them using the OpenSSL Python library.
- It also allows for decryption and extraction of the created files.
