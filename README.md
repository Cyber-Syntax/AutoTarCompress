## **🚀 Usage**

AutoTarCompress now offers two ways to use it:

### **🔥 New: Command-Line Interface (Recommended for automation)**

The CLI provides scriptable access to all backup operations:

```bash
# Show all available commands
autotarcompress --help

# Create a backup
autotarcompress backup

# Encrypt the latest backup
autotarcompress encrypt --latest

# Encrypt a backup from a specific date
autotarcompress encrypt --date 15-01-2024

# Encrypt a specific backup file
autotarcompress encrypt backup_15-01-2024_10-30-45.tar.xz

# Decrypt the latest encrypted backup
autotarcompress decrypt --latest

# Extract the latest backup
autotarcompress extract --latest

# Clean up old backups (uses config defaults)
autotarcompress cleanup

# Clean up keeping only 5 most recent backups
autotarcompress cleanup --keep 5

# Show last backup information
autotarcompress info
```

### **📋 Interactive Menu (Original experience)**

For users who prefer an interactive experience:

```bash
autotarcompress interactive
```

Or simply run without arguments (default behavior):

```bash
autotarcompress
```
